The HTML Canvas API will be used to enable interactive drawing, annotation, and manipulation of VSDs directly on storybook pages. The backend will be developed using Supabase to support user authentication, data storage, and management of storybooks, VSD collections, and vocabulary data. Supabase will also handle secure storage and retrieval of user-created content, including images, annotations, and text-to-speech settings. This includes the consistent storage of hotspots, vocabulary, and text-to-speech audio throughout closing and reopening of storybook allowing the hotspots to be fully interactive, only needing to be created once. The frontend will be hosted using Render, while Supabase will provide backend hosting and database services to support saving, editing, and reopening storybook VSDs across sessions."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"background",children:"Background"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Similar products include Proloquo2Go and TouchChat. These are both AAC applications that support communication through symbol-based grids and text-to-speech, allowing users to express basic needs and ideas. However, these tools are closed-source and are not specifically designed to support shared storybook reading or the creation of interactive, context-rich Visual Scene Displays (VSDs). Instead, these products focus on generic vocabulary with rigid customization without the emphasis of sharing a learning experience. These existing solutions have basic file navigation, decreasing usability by simulating an environment that forces the caretaker to spend extra time searching for the desired content. Proloquo2Go and TouchChat currently does not support highly interactive storybook options to keep the user engaged and connected. As a result, caregivers often need to manually adapt materials or rely on static visuals that limit engagement and flexibility during reading activities.\nOther AAC tools and research-based approaches emphasize the benefits of using visual scenes and personalized content to support language development and comprehension. Building on these ideas, the VSD Storybook application focuses on combining story-based AAC support with interactive and customizable VSDs. Similar to existing AAC tools, the application supports text-to-speech and vocabulary access, but it extends these features by enabling users to upload storybooks, annotate pages, and organize multiple VSDs into reusable libraries. This application aims to provide a more engaging and effective AAC experience by centering the design around storybook interaction and personalization for both individual and group reading contexts."})]})}function u(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,s.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,a.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,a.jsx)(l,{...e})}):l(e)}}}]);
