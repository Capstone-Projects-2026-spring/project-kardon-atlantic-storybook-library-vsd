## Project Abstract

This project proposes a progressive web application designed to support Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) users through the creation of interactive Visual Scene Displays (VSDs) for storybook reading. The application allows caregivers and educators to upload storybook pages, annotate images, and generate story-relevant vocabulary with customizable text-to-speech voices. Progress on integrating interaction, vocabulary support, and usage logging will help the system to improve engagement, comprehension, and communication during both individual and group reading activities.  This application provides an accessible and flexible tool that supports language development and inclusive literacy experiences for AAC users.  

## High Level Requirement

Describe the requirements – i.e., what the product does and how it does it from a user point of view – at a high level.

## Conceptual Design
The frontend of the application will be built using JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS. React will be used to create reusable UI components and manage application state, while JavaScript, HTML, and CSS will support user interactions, layout, and accessibility features. The HTML Canvas API will be used to enable interactive drawing, annotation, and manipulation of VSDs directly on storybook pages. The backend will be developed using Supabase to support user authentication, data storage, and management of storybooks, VSD collections, and vocabulary data. Supabase will also handle secure storage and retrieval of user-created content, including images, annotations, and text-to-speech settings. The frontend will be hosted using Render, while Supabase will provide backend hosting and database services to support saving, editing, and reopening storybook VSDs across sessions.

## Background

Similar products include Proloquo2Go and TouchChat. These are both AAC applications that support communication through symbol-based grids and text-to-speech, allowing users to express basic needs and ideas. However, these tools  are closed-source and are not specifically designed to support shared storybook reading or the creation of interactive, context-rich Visual Scene Displays (VSDs). As a result, caregivers often need to manually adapt materials or rely on static visuals that limit engagement and flexibility during reading activities.
Other AAC tools and research-based approaches emphasize the benefits of using visual scenes and personalized content to support language development and comprehension. Building on these ideas, the VSD Storybook application focuses on combining story-based AAC support with interactive and customizable VSDs. Similar to existing AAC tools, the application supports text-to-speech and vocabulary access, but it extends these features by enabling users to upload storybooks, annotate pages, and organize multiple VSDs into reusable libraries. This application aims to provide a more engaging and effective AAC experience by centering the design around storybook interaction and personalization for both individual and group reading contexts.


## Required Resources

Discuss what you need to develop this project. This includes background information you will need to acquire, hardware resources, and software resources. If these are not part of the standard Computer Science Department lab resources, these must be identified early and discussed with the instructor.
